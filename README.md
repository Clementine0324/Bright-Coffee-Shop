# Bright-Coffee-Shop
This report examines six months of daily sales across every Bright Coffee Shop location. Its purpose is to uncover actionable insights into revenue trends, product performance, and operational efficiency equipping the new CEO with the data-driven intelligence needed to inform strategic decisions. Identifying each store’s top-selling products is crucial for strategic inventory management and targeted promotions. By tailoring product assortments and marketing offers to the preferences of each location, Bright Coffee Shop can boost sales efficiency and customer satisfaction. To optimize performance across Bright Coffee Shop’s network, leverage the Hell’s Kitchen playbook to boost sales at underperforming locations, standardize promotion of top volume items to drive overall throughput; upsell Barista Espresso to raise average transaction value; reassess Green Beans—reposition, repackage, or replace to address underperformance, and conduct granular, store level product deep dives to ensure inventory matches each café’s unique demand.
